# Overview
A comprehensive business intelligence dashboard developed using Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize software test execution metrics across multiple dimensions. 
This project provides detailed insights into test case outcomes, defect severity distribution, defect reopen rates, blocked test trends, and tester performance.
The dashboard enables stakeholders such as QA managers, test leads, and developers to monitor test progress in real time, identify high-risk areas, and make data-driven decisions.
Key features include dynamic KPI cards, bar and pie charts, donut charts, line trends, and matrix visuals â€” all powered by DAX measures and interactive slicers. 
The solution simplifies root cause analysis for delays in test execution and highlights opportunities to improve testing efficiency and release quality.
